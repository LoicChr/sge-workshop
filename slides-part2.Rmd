Let's get into the basics of running jobs to the cluster...

# Queues 

## 

Although the cluster is just like any other computer, the way we run scripts is slightly different.

##

- If everyone ran the jobs directly to the cluster, it would be chaos!

- Jobs would be all running at the same time,

- it would be harder to prevent the cluster from crushing,

- it would be hard to manage multiple users...

##

That's why we need a queueing system...

## The queueing system

- Distributes jobs across nodes/cores

- Makes a waiting list

- Manages job priorities

- Ensures that jobs are contained and the nodes are shieded from possoble errors

- Ensures that jobs are run only within allocated resources (cores/RAM memory/time)

##

The master node hosts the queueing system. That's why we shouldn't run jobs there.

##

If the master node chrashes, the queueing system crashes too. Which means everyone's jobs might go with it. No one can use the cluster until the whole thing is reset. 

# SGE

##

There are multiple quewing systems available. Abacus uses SGE (Sun Grid Engine System). 

##

There are 4 basic commands we'll cover today

```{bash, eval = F}
qsub
qdel
qstat
qalter
```

# qsub

# qstat

# qdel

# qalter
